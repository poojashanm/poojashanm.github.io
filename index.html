                        In this project, identified a list of notable landmarks in the area and then use geocoding libraries 
                        or APIs to convert the addresses of the landmarks into geographic coordinates. Those are coordinates which are plotted on a map.
                        The map could display the locations of the landmarks with additional attribute information on each landmark, such as images, to create a more engaging and informative user experience.</p>
